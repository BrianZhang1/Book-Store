# Book Store

A simple MERN CRUD app using Vite and Tailwind for storing data on books. Purely personal practice/proof-of-concept for the tech stack.

To start the program, fill in your MongoDB connection string in `backend/config.js`, then start up both the frontend and backend servers. Open the frontend localhost port (default 5173) to view the app.
